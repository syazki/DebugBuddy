# 🐥 DebugBuddy

A playful Chrome extension that helps you debug by talking through your thoughts — inspired by the “rubber duck debugging” technique. Instead of feeling stuck alone, click on your floating companion and start thinking out loud.

## Features

- Always-visible companion: A friendly character floats in your browser, ready to listen
- Interactive click-to-start: Clicking the characer triggers an animation (like nodding) to encourage explanation
- Post-talk check-in: After you're done explaining, the extension asks if you solved the bug
- Unlockable characters: Progress by logging successful sessions and unlock new debugging buddies

## How It Works

- Install the extension in Chrome
- Click your character when you're stuck
- Talk through your problem out loud (just like a real rubber duck)
- At the end, you'll be asked if the issue was resolved
- Track your debugging wins and unlock new friends!
